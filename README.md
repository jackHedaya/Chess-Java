# Chess-Java

A remake of ChessJs for reasons stated <a href="https://github.com/jackHedaya/ChessJs/blob/master/README.md">there</a>.

Completed:
- All pieces are functional.
- Movement and piece selection.
- Fixed past mistake on selecting pieces. Now uses a grid system.

Incomplete:
- En passant. (once again)
- No use of Firebase, etc. This was meant to be a standalone chess game.
- No piece movement animation.
- No Check/Checkate. (once again)
